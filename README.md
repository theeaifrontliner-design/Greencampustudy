# Green Campus Study

A working research repository exploring the relationship between urban green spaces and student burnout among university students.

---

## Overview

Student burnout continues to rise across universities. Most interventions focus on workload adjustments or counseling services, but environmental design is rarely examined as a contributing factor.

This project investigates whether exposure to campus green spaces — such as gardens, tree-lined walkways, and outdoor study areas — correlates with reduced burnout symptoms and improved cognitive focus.

## Research Focus

Primary Question:

How does regular exposure to urban green spaces influence emotional exhaustion, mental fatigue, and academic engagement?

---

## Current Direction

- Reviewing literature on attentional restoration theory
- Identifying validated academic burnout measurement scales
- Exploring correlations between outdoor study habits and perceived productivity

---

## Open Questions

- Does frequency of green space exposure matter more than duration?
- Are certain types of natural spaces more restorative than others?
- Can environmental interventions reduce dependence on reactive mental health services?

## Status

Early-stage concept development.  
Literature collection ongoing.  
Methodology refinement in progress.
